# How to run a problem?
Each problem is solved within its own individual C# class and named accordingly to the problem. Within the `Program.cs` entry class, you can create a new object for each problem class and call its `Run()` method. Data structures are stored within its own `Structures` folder.

Example: Within program.cs's static main method, we're going to call the `TwoSum.cs`'s run method.
`TwoSum.Run()`
